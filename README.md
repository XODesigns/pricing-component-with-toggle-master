### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I've learnt that there is more to learn when it comes to grid display. I struggled abit with a responsive design, had to create alot of @media properties to counter that
and i dont believe is the right practice.

### Continued development

Learning about responsive development and its implimintation - without using to much overlapping code.
